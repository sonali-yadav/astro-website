            <p class="lead">
                We are connected to the planets and stars that surround us, and are actually
                a part of them. The deepest and closest connection we have is to the planets
                of our own solar system. Each planet represents another territory in our lives,
                another part of the spectrum of living, of the parts that compose us, Of the
                four forces: gravity, electromagnetism, nuclear-strong, and nuclear-weak,
                only the first two, gravity and EM, affect things over distances
                (at least, over distances larger than an atomic nucleus).
                So, if the planets and stars have any direct influence on us it should be
                by way of one or both of those forces.

                Stones, Crystals and Metals as well as Colour, Earth, Air, Water, Fire,
                Akash, Ourselves, our Planet and our Universe all contains ENERGY.
                It is this energy, which permits everything in this universe to make it
                function. This energy source is actually beyond Religion, beyond theory or
                explanation.
