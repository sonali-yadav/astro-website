            She is the mother to millions of Indian mankind. Protection of the cow means
            protection of the whole creation of God. The ancient seer, whoever he was,
            began with the cow. The appeal of the lower order of creation is all the more
            forcible because it is speechless."

        <h2>Donation Invites for Cow Shelter (Gaushala)</h2>
        <p>A Cowpen (Gaushala) is situated in Kanpur at Itahara farm where the cows of
            Sahiwal are being reared under a protected environment. The aim of preservation of the cows
            is to give better shelter and save the reared variety of cow Sahiwal and give them a natural
            vedic atmosphere under the mission of  Indian Vedic Foundation.</p>
        <h2>Cows and the Vedas</h2>
        <p>The Vedas teach us that the cow is the personalized embodiment of <strong>Kamadhenu</strong>,
            abode to the gods and demigods, who fulfills all our wishes, blessed by the rays
            and influences of the heavenly constellations and Gods. <strong>Only the Desi Indian cows
            have that characteristic hump with a Surya Ketu Nadi, a vein that passes through
            her backbone and absorbs the sun’s rays, resulting in a golden hue to its milk,
            ghee and butter</strong>. The cow’s milk and body fluids are endowed with several salts
            that offer cures to diverse diseases of the human body. In its stature as mother
            to every living being, it also provides pleasure to all. That the cow can absorb an
            intake of poisonous food, without passing on the negative aspects of it to her milk,
            urine or dung is unbelievable; what can you attribute to this, other than divine
            intervention.  They are totally harmless and the milk is not toxic at all.
            When the urine of other animals is tested after feeding it them with a variety of
            mildly poisonous food, their urine shows traces of them, but cow's urine didn't show
            any such response. This proves that cows are the only living beings that are able to
            digest poisonous compounds too. Hence it becomes necessary to save them for mankind</p>
